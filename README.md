# % of titles provide the vast majority of the time viewed.

1) I grouped (jooned) two tables (Table1 and Table2) by the content_id property.
2) Then group by title and wrote a small code, procedure to see how many % of views were generate by each title.
For example:
Title 1: 70% of views
Title 2: 15% of views
etc...

The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. In other words, a small percentage of causes have an outsized effect. This concept is important to understand because it can help you identify which initiatives to prioritize so you can make the most impact.

3) I have created my task.py file where I run my code and results were written in CSV files: title_per, genres.

4) It seems like top 10 titles produce 20% of views, and titles that have small % produce 80% of views.
Titles with small % produce 80% not just individuals, but whole small %
titles.
So I calculated % of titles that are more than >1% out of all titles. count_big_titles = 2.17 %
count_small_titles = 97.83%
